# Actor Connector
** A social Network MERN stack social network for Actors **

Definitely a big project, based on a few other projects. 
It has a custom SCSS React front end and a back end with tonnes of CRUD functionality.
You can sign up with a dummy email, add profile info, experience, training. You can write and like posts,
write comments and much more.

I may add image upload, but it is currently only hosted for free on Netlify with a free MongoDB database, so it
wouldn't be a quick feature.
